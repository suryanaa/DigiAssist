Description of the project:

DigiAssist is designed to digitally assist people who require frequent medication. 
This application can help users monitor their medicaal regimen as well as their vital statistics. 
This can help physicians understand the patients health status better and enable them to take steps to control diseases as well as prevent costly exacerbations.

Moreover, by aggregating this voluntarily-shared data about symptoms, it is possible to improve 
management and understanding of diseases. 
With this kind of information/statistic, scientists and public health agencies can design new medication 
that reduces the burden on patients.
Patients also benefit since they reduce costs incurred by frequently visiting hospitals 
or availing emergency services.

This application can be extended to facilitate assistance to nurses or health care professionals 
who are in charge of the terminally ill or mentally ill.

DigiAssist is a personlized digital health care assistant that can
--collect measurements of health parameters . 
  Some of the parameters include Weight, pain level, blood glucose level,blood pressure, temperature
--Request information from the health care community via personalised patient forms 
--Set up a health log/diary
--Manage reminders and alerts to refill prescription as well as keep track of medications dosage.
--Manage a calendar to help with regular medication. 
--Provide access to details of medication 

Intended Audience:

This app is meant for those users who require health care assistance but not hospitalization. 
i.e.,
--Patients who have recently undergone a medical or surgical procedure
--Elderly patients
--patients with long term illness who opt for home based care
--chronically ill patients
