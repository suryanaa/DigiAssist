DigiAssist is designed to digitally assist people who require frequent health care. This application can help users :
--Monitor their medical regimen - Users are reminded to take their medication at the designated time. Users can also view their daily medical schedule as well as view details of the medication prescribed to them.
--Keep track of their vital statistics - Users can log their health details (blood pressure, glucose level etc). This can help physicians understand the patients health status better and enable them to take steps to control diseases. By aggregating this voluntarily-shared data, it is possible to improve management and understanding of diseases. With this kind of information/statistic, scientists and public health agencies can design new medication that reduces the burden on patients.
--Communicate with their health care provider in case of minor ailments such as nausea, headache etc.
--Keep track of medical supplies and be alerted when the supply needs to be replenished.

Patients benefit from this approach since they reduce costs incurred by frequently visiting hospitals or availing emergency services.
This application can be extended to provide assistance to nurses or health care professionals who are in charge of the terminally ill or mentally ill.

This app is meant for those users who require health care assistance but not hospitalization. i.e.,

--Patients who have recently undergone a medical or surgical procedure
--Elderly patients
--patients with long term illness who opt for home based care
--chronically ill patients
